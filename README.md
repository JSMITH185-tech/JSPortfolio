## About Me

MSc. Artificial Intelligence student

An early-career developer with an interest in game development and AI research. I am currently strengthening my skillset in Unity and C# through personal projects, academic work, and hands-on experience. I am interested in gameplay systems, technical design and the role of code in creating smooth user experiences and satisfying game feel. I also enjoy exploring 3D art and creative tools alongside development.

## Projects

**Hospital Simulation**
![Bike Study](/assets/HospitalSimulation.png)
Unity-based hospital simulation game modeling real-time patient flow through departments
Focused on creating a streamlined, educational gameplay experience inspired by real-world triage systems.
Interactive UI, character AI, resource tracking and allocation

**Genre and Decade Classification System**
Developed and evaluated four CNN models (genre-only, decade-only, multi-output, and feature-feed) to classify music tracks by genre and decade using the FMA-Small dataset. Achieved up to 85% genre accuracy and 70% decade accuracy, with analysis showing limited benefit from combining genre and decade predictions. Conducted case studies with real tracks to assess model generalization, highlighting challenges in temporal classification.

**Reddit Sentiment Analysis**
Overall sentiment of Reddit posts comments using Python libraries, SQL and React.js

**QMLAC Chatbot**
Designed the official chatbot for the university's Legal Advice Centre, integrating NLP, Node.js, and Python backend.

**Final Year Project**
Using Kinect for Windows in order to navigate a RaspberryPi robot through a maze via gesture recognition. Developed using C#, ASP.NET for Naïve Bayes and Random Forest classification of gesture instance and Java for remote TCP/IP control of the robot. 



**Brunel University Swiftbot**
Contributed to the design of the university's RPI programming module, focusing on software testing, PowerShell, Selenium, and documentation for back and front-end  development via PHP, Wordpress, Javascript, HTML.

**Move, Shoot & Avoid 2D Game**
![Bike Study](/assets/MoveShootAvoid.png)
Created using HTML 5, Javascript, uses random enemy generation, sound effects and collision detection
